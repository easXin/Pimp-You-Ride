Variables includes instance variable, class Variables, local variables, parameters, and we two categories of data type in the Java, which known as primitive type and non-primitive type, we will go over more example of how to use them as we follow along the tutorial.

And for statement, statement forms a complete unit of expression and terminating wiht a semicolon. Expressions are used to compute and to assign values to variables and to help control the execution flow of a program. The job of an expression is to perform the computation indicated by the elements of the expression and to return a value that is the result of the computation. Unlocked background:: Spiderverse",

This topic contains four different types, they are looping type (eg. while, do-while, for ) , decision making type (eg. if-else, switch-case ) , exception handling type (eg. try-catch-finally, throw ) ,and branching type (eg. break, continue, label:, return ) respectively. With using control flow statements in your programs to conditionally execute statements, you can repeatedly execute same block of statements with least amount of code, so let's get start it.
